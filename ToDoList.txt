These list all the features missing from the rework

//////////////////////
//	Mission Design	//
//////////////////////

ðŸ—¸ Determine how much resources should the AI commander keep on each objective
	For example, on a low scored Area the AI commander should try to keep fewer soldiers and vehicles
ðŸ—¸ Create files that contain default soldier and vehicles to be used for the Commander AI
	This should make it easier to port the mission to mods, such as RHS
- Create files that contain supply crate equipments for both sides
ðŸ—¸ Implement a cunstruction system
- Implement a simple vehicle shop for BLUEFOR

//////////////////////
//	Mission Logic	//
//////////////////////

ðŸ—¸ Get area information from local database
- Update area information to local database
ðŸ—¸ Save player created srtuctures and vehicles to database
	BLUEFOR will be able to capture resources from OPFOR, but we still need a source of income in case BLUEFOR runs completely dry
- Spawn supply crates for BLUEFOR if the area has resources when it activates
- Determine when an area is "under attack"
- Generate OPFOR resources for each area
	Supply boxes
ðŸ—¸ Set veight limits on certain vehicle positions (such as plane pilots and tank drivers)

//////////////////////
//	Commander AI	//
//////////////////////

- Determine highest non-captured Area
	This will be marked as the capital
	This area will have a balaned production focus, starting on level 2
- Distribute starting resources based on score

//////////////////////
//	Commander Logic	//
//////////////////////

- Send resources to capital when capital still has "capacity"
	The mission determines how much resources should each area keep, if there's excess and the capital is short on resources, the commander should send resources to the capital
- Recruit/create assets
	This includes determining what and when to create. For example, if the area met it's asset quota, it will stay idle to generate resources for the capital
	On the other hand, the capital will try to create excess assets to distribute
- Upgrade resource "generators"
- Send out logi trucks with resources when necessary
	When areas have excess, they should send it to the capital
- Distribute assets from capital
	Excess infantry and vehicles should be moved from the capital (but not from other places)
- Reinforce attacked areas
	If the (maximum) two closest areas have excess infantry/vehicles, they should send them over to assist
- Create outposts for areas
	These outposts will alert the area it's tied to (if it is active), and set it to being in combat

//////////////////////
//	BLUEFOR Logic	//
//////////////////////

ðŸ—¸ Save players position inside a vehicle
	Should only be saved in persistent vehicles
- Create some sort of income for the BLUEFOR side
- Setup "deployable" vehicles for FOB construction
- Setup a vehicle shop for blufor
